# Galileo University Proposal for HoverGames Challenge 
**Elevator pitch:** The approach of Turing Lab at Galileo University offers propose the use of drones to help firemen setting landmarks of clusters of people to create a dynamic map that indicates the dimensions of the fire and the location of the groups of persons that are in danger.

## Modules description
### Lepton Module
This is a modified package of the Lepton repository from Groupgets that makes it possible to interface the IR camera with the Raspberry Pi 3. Our module makes it possible to take screenshots of the IR image and receive the thermal signal with a shutterless lens.

### Stream 
This module contains a script that sends over UDP the video feed from the usb camera attached to the Raspberry Pi. The python script receives the video signal to the main computer using Opencv functions. Currently we are using a conventional router to stream the video with a range of approximately 100m. This limitation will be enhanced by getting a more robust transmiter. 

### YOLOv3
Here a custom version of YOLOv3 was adapted to detect persons, animals and cars. This are the main features intended to be inserted on to the map that will be used by the rescue teams that need to locate survivors and the fire status.

### ROS
In Turing Lab, we are great enthusiasts of using ROS and for this project we made use of the packages of MAVROS and MAPVIZ. MavRos gave us the opportunity to communicate with the drone using Mavlkink messages that provide all the information needed from the sensors of the drone. 
MapViz is a GPS visual interface that makes possible to generate maps, rutes and point positions on a global localization enviroment. 

## Bill of materials
Aditional to the NXP Drone Kit our team add some components to the system.

### Mapviz Screenshot
![mapviz-screenshot](assets/mapviz-screenshot.jpg?raw=true)
Mapviz is used as a visualization tool to show up where the drone is in a map (provided by the Bing Maps API) using the GPS information. Furthermore the trajectory of the drone is draw in the map using a red line. Moreover the video that is being captured from the camera that is in the drone is displayed in the left superior corner.
We are currently working in add people, animals and other objects in the map as markers and also add the information from the thermal camera as a heat map to help the rescue teams in their tasks.

## CAD Files
To equip the drone with the additional gear for our project, there were necessary some 3D printed parts that we make available on the next GrabCad folder.
